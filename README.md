# Crawler
   This is a crawler with a tool of Jsoup. For the java crawler, we can manually modify the code to set the number of records per crawl.
   
   Then, we add a python version. It can offer more functions for more specific requirements. However, the smart contract that is crawled is not represented in the structure of the source code, but is concatenated into a string.
